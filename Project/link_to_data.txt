Reasons to choose the data:
My paternal grandfather used to live in Islamabad and as a child I frequented the city during my vacations. Moreover I have also lived and 
attended school in the city when I was in grade 9 and 10. Islamabad is the federal capital of Pakistan. It was constructed in late 1960's 
when President Field Matrtial Ayub Khan decided to shift the capital from Karachi to a place near the General Army Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
That is the reason why Rawalpindi is also called the twin city of Islamabad. I was not not surprised when I discovered that a lot of data 
from Rawalpindi was part of the metro extracts osm file.
